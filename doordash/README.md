1. Which SOLID principle(s) is this company violating?
- In the Doorash company, two SOLID principles this company violates are Single Responsibility Principle and Interface Segregation Principle.
- The ‘FoodDeliveryAndTrackingService’ class has multiple responsibilities. It handles both delivering food and tracking packages. It violates SRP
- The ‘DeliveryService’ interface has two methods and one new method I add is notification of the delivery, but not all classes that implement this interface may need both methods.It violates ISP.
2. Your approach to making changes to fix the violation.
- After adding a new function call notification in ‘DeliveryService’, I will split it into separate interfaces for delivering food, tracking packages, and notification. 
- Split the 'FoodDeliveryAndTrackingService' class into three separate classes: one for delivering food, another for tracking packages, and one for notification when the food is delivered.
- Modify the ‘FoodDelivery’ class to use the ‘NotificationService’ for notifying the customer
